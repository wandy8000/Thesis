@article{Kasprzak2006,
abstract = {Phase transitions to quantum condensed phases--such as Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), superfluidity, and superconductivity--have long fascinated scientists, as they bring pure quantum effects to a macroscopic scale. BEC has, for example, famously been demonstrated in dilute atom gas of rubidium atoms at temperatures below 200 nanokelvin. Much effort has been devoted to finding a solid-state system in which BEC can take place. Promising candidate systems are semiconductor microcavities, in which photons are confined and strongly coupled to electronic excitations, leading to the creation of exciton polaritons. These bosonic quasi-particles are 10(9) times lighter than rubidium atoms, thus theoretically permitting BEC to occur at standard cryogenic temperatures. Here we detail a comprehensive set of experiments giving compelling evidence for BEC of polaritons. Above a critical density, we observe massive occupation of the ground state developing from a polariton gas at thermal equilibrium at 19 K, an increase of temporal coherence, and the build-up of long-range spatial coherence and linear polarization, all of which indicate the spontaneous onset of a macroscopic quantum phase.},

A large increase in optical output power of 38\% is achieved at an injection current of 20 mA due to an improved internal quantum efficiency of the LEDs. The enhancement of optical output power is dependent on the density of the Ag nanoparticles. This improvement can be attributed to an increase in the spontaneous emission rate through resonance coupling between the excitons in multiple quantum wells and localized surface plasmons in Ag nanoparticles embedded in p-GaN.},

@article{Ahmad2014,
abstract = {The properties of layered inorganic semiconductors can be manipulated by the insertion of foreign molecular species via a process known as intercalation. In the present study, we investigate the phenomenon of organic moiety (R-NH3I) intercalation in layered metal-halide (PbI2)-based inorganic semiconductors, leading to the formation of inorganic-organic (IO) perovskites [(R-NH3)2PbI4]. During this intercalation strong resonant exciton optical transitions are created, enabling study of the dynamics of this process. Simultaneous in-situ photoluminescence (PL) and transmission measurements are used to track the structural and exciton evolution. Based on the experimental observations, a model is proposed which explains the process of IO perovskite formation during intercalation of the organic moiety through the inorganic semiconductor layers. The interplay between precursor film thickness and organic solution concentration/solvent highlights the role of van der Waals interactions between the layers, as well as the need for maintaining stoichiometry during intercalation. Nucleation and growth occurring during intercalation matches a Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model, with results fitting both ideal and non-ideal cases.},

Temperature and excitation power dependance of the optical spectra gives a new insight into the excitonic and the phononic properties of this hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductor. In particular, exciton-phonon interaction is found to be more than one order of magnitude higher than in GaAs QWs. As a result, photoluminescence emission lines have to be interpreted in the framework of a polaron model.},

Each structure was refined in a monoclinic (C2/m) subcell, with the lattice parameters a = 39.712(13) A, b = 5.976(2) A, c = 6.043(2) A, beta = 92.238(5) degrees, and Z = 2 for M = Bi and a = 39.439(7) A, b = 5.952(1) A, c = 6.031(1) A, beta = 92.245(3) degrees, and Z = 2 for M = Sb. The trivalent metal cations locally adopt a distorted octahedral coordination, with M-I bond lengths ranging from 3.046(1) to 3.218(3) A (3.114 A average) for M = Bi and 3.012(1) to 3.153(2) A (3.073 A average) for M = Sb. The new organic-inorganic hybrids are the first members of a metal-deficient perovskite family consisting of (Mn+)2/nV(n-2)/nX4(2-) sheets, where V represents a vacancy (generally left out of the formula) and the metal cation valence, n, is greater than 2. The organic layers in the AEQT-based organic-inorganic hybrids feature edge-to-face aromatic interactions among the rigid, rodlike quaterthiophene moieties, which may help to stabilize the unusual metal-deficient layered structures.},

abstract = {Crystals of several new hybrid tin(II) iodide-based perovskites, involving 2,3,4,5,6- pentafluorophenethylammonium or phenethylammonium cation bilayers and intercalated aryl or perfluoroaryl molecules, were grown by slow evaporation of a methanol solution containing the hybrid perovskite and the intercalating species. The (C(6)F(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4).(C(6)H(6)) structure was solved at -75 degrees C in a monoclinic C2/c subcell [a = 41.089(12) A, b = 6.134(2) A, c = 12.245(3) A, beta = 94.021(5) degrees, Z = 4] and consists of sheets of corner-sharing distorted SnI(6) octahedra separated by bilayers of pentafluorophenethylammonium cations. The intercalated benzene molecules form a single well-ordered layer interposed between adjacent fluoroaryl cation layers. The corresponding hybrid with an unfluorinated organic cation and fluorinated intercalating molecule, (C(6)H(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4).(C(6)F(6)), is isostructural [a = 40.685(4) A, b = 6.0804(6) A, c = 12.163(1) A, beta = 93.136(2) degrees, Z = 4]. For each intercalated system, close C...C contacts (3.44-3.50 A) between the aromatic cation and the intercalated molecule are indicative of a significant face-to-face interaction, similar to that found in the complex C(6)H(6).C(6)F(6). Crystal growth runs with the organic cation and prospective intercalating molecule either both fluorinated or both unfluorinated did not yield stable intercalated compounds, demonstrating the significance of fluoroaryl-aryl interactions in the current intercalated structures. Thermal analysis of (C(6)F(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4).(C(6)H(6)) and (C(6)H(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4).(C(6)F(6)) crystals yields, in addition to the characteristic transitions of the parent perovskite, endothermic transitions [12.6(5) and 32.1(8) kJ/mol, respectively] with an onset at 145 degrees C and a weight loss corresponding to the complete loss of the intercalated molecule. The relatively high deintercalation temperature (well above the boiling point of benzene and hexafluorobenzene) demonstrates the usefulness of the hybrid perovskites in providing a stable framework for the examination of the fluoroaryl-aryl interaction, as well as the potential importance of this interaction in tailoring new hybrid perovskites. UV-vis absorption measurements on (C(6)H(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4).(C(6)F(6)) thin films indicate a small reversible wavelength shift to higher energy for the tin(II) iodide framework exciton peak (with respect to that of the parent perovskite spectrum), from 608(2) nm [2.04 eV] to 595(2) nm [2.08 eV], and a corresponding shift in the band edge position. This spectral shift can most reasonably be attributed to subtle structural changes induced in the tin(II) iodide sheets by the intercalated hexafluorobenzene molecules.},

abstract = {Optoelectronic-compatible heterostructures are fabricated from layered inorganic-organic multiple quantum wells (IO-MQW) of Cyclohexenyl ethyl ammonium lead iodide, (C(6)H(9)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)PbI(4) (CHPI). These hybrids possess strongly-resonant optical features, are thermally stable and compatible with hybrid photonics assembly. Room-temperature strong-coupling is observed when these hybrids are straightforwardly embedded in metal-air (M-A) and metal-metal (M-M) low-Q microcavities, due to the large oscillator strength of these IO-MQWs. The strength of the Rabi splitting is 130 meV for M-A and 160 meV for M-M cavities. These values are significantly higher than for J-aggregates in all-metal microcavities of similar length. These experimental results are in good agreement with transfer matrix simulations based on resonant excitons. Incorporating exciton-switching hybrids allows active control of the strong-coupling parameters by temperature, suggesting new device applications.},

abstract = {Gold nanorods have been receiving extensive attention owing to their extremely attractive applications in biomedical technologies, plasmon-enhanced spectroscopies, and optical and optoelectronic devices. The growth methods and plasmonic properties of Au nanorods have therefore been intensively studied. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the flourishing field of Au nanorods in the past five years. We will focus mainly on the approaches for the growth, shape and size tuning, functionalization, and assembly of Au nanorods, as well as the methods for the preparation of their hybrid structures. The plasmonic properties and the associated applications of Au nanorods will also be discussed in detail.},

abstract = {Silver nanobars with rectangular side facets and an average aspect ratio of 2.7 have been synthesized by modifying the concentration of bromide added to a polyol synthesis. Subsequent rounding of nanobars transformed them into nanorice. Due to their anisotropy, nanobars and nanorice exhibit two plasmon resonance peaks, scattering light both in the visible and in the near-infrared regions. With a combination of discrete-dipole approximation calculations and single-nanoparticle spectroscopy, we explored the effect of nanostructure aspect ratio and corner sharpness on the frequency of plasmon resonance. Near-field calculations and surface-enhanced Raman scattering measurements on single particles were performed to show how local field enhancement changes with both the wavelength and polarization of incident light.},

Both simulation and experimental results indicate that compared with regular plasmonic NPs, such as nano-spheres, irregular popcorn-shaped alloy NPs exhibit absorption enhancement over a broad wavelength range due to the excitation of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) at different wavelengths. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSCs is enhanced by 16\% from 5.26\% to 6.09\% by incorporating 2.38 wt\% Au-Ag alloy popcorn NPs. Moreover, by adding a scattering layer on the exterior of the counter electrode, the popcorn NPs demonstrate an even stronger ability to increase the PCE by 32\% from 5.94\% to 7.85\%, which results from the more efficient excitation of the LSP mode on the popcorn NPs.},

To facilitate engineering the properties of a thin film by manipulating its real structure, thin-film formation is reviewed as a process starting with nucleation followed by coalescence and subsequent thickness growth, all stages of which can be influenced by deposition parameters. The focus in this review is on dielectric and metallic films and their optical properties. In contrast to optoelectronics all these film growth possibilities for the engineering of novel optical films with extraordinary properties are just beginning to be used.},

Illumination with standard AM-1.5 sunlight generated large photocurrents (J(SC)) exceeding 17 mA/cm(2), an open circuit photovoltage (V(OC)) of 0.888 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.62 yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.7\%, the highest reported to date for such cells. Femto second laser studies combined with photo-induced absorption measurements showed charge separation to proceed via hole injection from the excited (CH(3)NH(3))PbI(3) NPs into the spiro-MeOTAD followed by electron transfer to the mesoscopic TiO(2) film. The use of a solid hole conductor dramatically improved the device stability compared to (CH(3)NH(3))PbI(3) -sensitized liquid junction cells.},

We report a low-cost, solution-processable solar cell, based on a highly crystalline perovskite absorber with intense visible to near-infrared absorptivity, that has a power conversion efficiency of 10.9\% in a single-junction device under simulated full sunlight. This "meso-superstructured solar cell" exhibits exceptionally few fundamental energy losses; it can generate open-circuit photovoltages of more than 1.1 volts, despite the relatively narrow absorber band gap of 1.55 electron volts. The functionality arises from the use of mesoporous alumina as an inert scaffold that structures the absorber and forces electrons to reside in and be transported through the perovskite.},

abstract = {Many different photovoltaic technologies are being developed for large-scale solar energy conversion. The wafer-based first-generation photovoltaic devices have been followed by thin-film solid semiconductor absorber layers sandwiched between two charge-selective contacts and nanostructured (or mesostructured) solar cells that rely on a distributed heterojunction to generate charge and to transport positive and negative charges in spatially separated phases. Although many materials have been used in nanostructured devices, the goal of attaining high-efficiency thin-film solar cells in such a way has yet to be achieved. Organometal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a promising material for high-efficiency nanostructured devices. Here we show that nanostructuring is not necessary to achieve high efficiencies with this material: a simple planar heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite as the absorbing layer can have solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of over 15 per cent (as measured under simulated full sunlight). This demonstrates that perovskite absorbers can function at the highest efficiencies in simplified device architectures, without the need for complex nanostructures.},

abstract = {We have clearly discriminated the single-, bilayer-, and multiple-layer graphene (<10 layers) on Si substrate with a 285 nm SiO2 capping layer by using contrast spectra, which were generated from the reflection light of a white light source. Calculations based on Fresnel's law are in excellent agreement with the experimental results (deviation 2\%). The contrast image shows the reliability and efficiency of this new technique. The contrast spectrum is a fast, nondestructive, easy to be carried out, and unambiguous way to identify the numbers of layers of graphene sheet. We provide two easy-to-use methods to determine the number of graphene layers based on contrast spectra: a graphic method and an analytical method. We also show that the refractive index of graphene is different from that of graphite. The results are compared with those obtained using Raman spectroscopy.},

Here, we describe optimal imaging conditions for the optical detection of ultrathin, two-dimensional dichalcogenide nanocrystals containing single, double and triple layers of MoS(2), WSe(2) and NbSe(2). A simple optical model is used to calculate the contrast for nanolayers deposited on wafers with varying thicknesses of SiO(2). The model is extended for imaging using the green channel of a video camera. Using AFM and optical imaging we confirm that single layers of MoS(2) and WSe(2) can be detected on 90 and 270 nm SiO(2) using optical means. By measuring contrast under broadband green illumination we are also able to distinguish between nanostructures containing single, double and triple layers of MoS(2) and WSe(2.) We observe and discuss discrepancies in the case of NbSe(2).},

abstract = {Motivated by the triumph and limitation of graphene for electronic applications, atomically thin layers of group VI transition metal dichalcogenides are attracting extensive interest as a class of graphene-like semiconductors with a desired band-gap in the visible frequency range. The monolayers feature a valence band spin splitting with opposite sign in the two valleys located at corners of 1st Brillouin zone. This spin-valley coupling, particularly pronounced in tungsten dichalcogenides, can benefit potential spintronics and valleytronics with the important consequences of spin-valley interplay and the suppression of spin and valley relaxations. Here we report the first optical studies of WS2 and WSe2 monolayers and multilayers. The efficiency of second harmonic generation shows a dramatic even-odd oscillation with the number of layers, consistent with the presence (absence) of inversion symmetry in even-layer (odd-layer). Photoluminescence (PL) measurements show the crossover from an indirect band gap semiconductor at mutilayers to a direct-gap one at monolayers. The PL spectra and first-principle calculations consistently reveal a spin-valley coupling of 0.4 eV which suppresses interlayer hopping and manifests as a thickness independent splitting pattern at valence band edge near K points. This giant spin-valley coupling, together with the valley dependent physical properties, may lead to rich possibilities for manipulating spin and valley degrees of freedom in these atomically thin 2D materials.},

abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) usually exhibit a low light outcoupling efficiency because a large fraction of power is lost to surface plasmons (SPs) and waveguide modes. In this paper it is demonstrated that periodic grating structures with almost µm-scale can be used to extract SPs as well as waveguide modes and therefore enhance the outcoupling efficiency in light-emitting thin film structures. The gratings are fabricated by nanoimprint lithography using a commercially available diffraction grating as a mold which is pressed into a polymer resist. The outcoupling of SPs and waveguide modes is detected in fluorescent organic films adjacent to a thin metal layer in angular dependent photoluminescence measurements. Scattering up to 5th-order is observed and the extracted modes are identified by comparison to the SP and waveguide dispersion obtained from optical simulations. In order to demonstrate the low-cost, high quality and large area applicability of grating structures in optoelectronic devices, we also present SP extraction using a grating structure fabricated by a common DVD stamp.},

abstract = {Excitation of localized and delocalized surface plasmon resonances can be used for turning excellent reflectors of visible light, such as gold and silver, into efficient absorbers, whose wavelength, polarization or angular bandwidths are however necessarily limited owing to the resonant nature of surface plasmon excitations involved. Nonresonant absorption has so far been achieved by using combined nano- and micro-structural surface modifications and with composite materials involving metal nanoparticles embedded in dielectric layers. Here we realize nonresonant light absorption in a well-defined geometry by using ultra-sharp convex metal grooves via adiabatic nanofocusing of gap surface plasmon modes excited by scattering off subwavelength-sized wedges. We demonstrate experimentally that two-dimensional arrays of sharp convex grooves in gold ensure efficient (>87\%) broadband (450-850 nm) absorption of unpolarized light, reaching an average level of 96\%. Efficient absorption of visible light by nanostructured metal surfaces open new exciting perspectives within plasmonics, especially for thermophotovoltaics.},

abstract = {Immobilized gold colloid particles coated with a C-18 alkylsilane layer have been characterized as a substrate for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) studies of adsorption onto hydrophobic surfaces. Atomic force microscopy images, optical extinction spectra, and SERS measurements are reported as a function of accumulation of gold colloid on glass. As the metal particles become increasingly aggregated on the surface, the SERS enhancement increases until the plasmon resonance shifts to wavelengths longer than the excitation laser. The gold colloid substrates are stable and exhibit reproducible SERS enhancement. When octadecyltrimethoxysilane is self-assembled over the gold, the metal surface is protected from exposure to solution-phase species, as evidenced by the inhibition of chemisorption of a disulfide reagent to the overcoated gold surface. The results show that interactions with gold can be blocked by a silane layer so as not to significantly influence physisorption of molecules at the C-18/solution interface. The SERS enhancement from these C-18-overcoated gold substrates is reproducible for different films prepared from the same colloidal suspension; the substrates are also stable with time and upon exposure to laser irradiation.},

Femtosecond excitation drastically alters the optical properties of a model system formed by coating a gold nanoslit array with a thin J-aggregated dye layer. Controlled and reversible transient switching from strong ($\Omega$(R) ≃ 55 meV) to weak ($\Omega$(R) ≈ 0) coupling on a sub-ps time scale is directly evidenced by mapping the nonequilibrium dispersion relations of the coupled excitations. Such a strong, externally controllable coupling of excitons and surface plasmon polaritons is of considerable interest for ultrafast all-optical switching applications in nanoscale plasmonic circuits.},

This transformation has been followed by a conventional powder X-ray diffraction system equipped with a super speed detector, and both solid-state (13)C NMR and ESI/MS measurements have been adopted in the estimation of the rate of halide substitution. The first reaction step leads to the special composition of x approximately 1 (A phase), while the complete substitution is not achieved even at elevated temperature (x(max) approximately 1.85 (B phase)). This unprecedented solid-state reaction between organic and inorganic components of a hybrid perovskite can be considered as a completely new strategy to achieve interesting hybrid perovskites.},

abstract = {A hybrid film of layered niobate and an organic amphiphile was prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method. Trimethylammonium-exchanged perovskite-type niobates ((CH(3))(3)NHSr(2)Nb(3)O(10)) were exfoliative to form an aqueous suspension. A monolayer of octadecylamine was produced on such an aqueous dispersion as a template for a hybrid film. A hybrid film was transferred as a Y-type LB film onto a hydrophilic glass plate or an ITO substrate. The structure of a deposited film was investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, indicating a layer-by-layer structure with a single or double sheet of niobate as an inorganic composite. From the cyclic voltammogram on an ITO electrode modified with the Y-type 10 layered film, the lower edge of the conduction band of a niobate layer was determined to be - 0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl). ac impedance and dc measurements were carried out on 1, 5, and 10-layered LB films (2 mm (electrode spacing) x 8 mm (width)) with aluminum electrodes. The freshly deposited samples behaved as an insulator under the illumination of 280 nm light (2.04 x 10(16) quanta s(-1)). Photoconductivities appeared, however, when they were preirradiated with a 150 W Xe lamp (ca. 2 x 10(18) quanta s(-1)) for 0.5-8.5 h. The process was denoted as photomodification. From the FT-IR and XRD results, it was deduced that the photomodification of LB films caused the decomposition of organic templates (octadecylammonium) accompanied by the collapse of layer-by-layer structures. dc analyses on the 5- and 10-layered films after photomodification also showed that they behaved as a photosemiconductor under UV light illumination.},

abstract = {Crystals of several new hybrid tin(II) iodide-based perovskites, involving 2,3,4,5,6- pentafluorophenethylammonium or phenethylammonium cation bilayers and intercalated aryl or perfluoroaryl molecules, were grown by slow evaporation of a methanol solution containing the hybrid perovskite and the intercalating species. The (C(6)F(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4).(C(6)H(6)) structure was solved at -75 degrees C in a monoclinic C2/c subcell [a = 41.089(12) A, b = 6.134(2) A, c = 12.245(3) A, beta = 94.021(5) degrees, Z = 4] and consists of sheets of corner-sharing distorted SnI(6) octahedra separated by bilayers of pentafluorophenethylammonium cations. The intercalated benzene molecules form a single well-ordered layer interposed between adjacent fluoroaryl cation layers. The corresponding hybrid with an unfluorinated organic cation and fluorinated intercalating molecule, (C(6)H(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4).(C(6)F(6)), is isostructural [a = 40.685(4) A, b = 6.0804(6) A, c = 12.163(1) A, beta = 93.136(2) degrees, Z = 4]. For each intercalated system, close C...C contacts (3.44-3.50 A) between the aromatic cation and the intercalated molecule are indicative of a significant face-to-face interaction, similar to that found in the complex C(6)H(6).C(6)F(6). Crystal growth runs with the organic cation and prospective intercalating molecule either both fluorinated or both unfluorinated did not yield stable intercalated compounds, demonstrating the significance of fluoroaryl-aryl interactions in the current intercalated structures. Thermal analysis of (C(6)F(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4).(C(6)H(6)) and (C(6)H(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4).(C(6)F(6)) crystals yields, in addition to the characteristic transitions of the parent perovskite, endothermic transitions [12.6(5) and 32.1(8) kJ/mol, respectively] with an onset at 145 degrees C and a weight loss corresponding to the complete loss of the intercalated molecule. The relatively high deintercalation temperature (well above the boiling point of benzene and hexafluorobenzene) demonstrates the usefulness of the hybrid perovskites in providing a stable framework for the examination of the fluoroaryl-aryl interaction, as well as the potential importance of this interaction in tailoring new hybrid perovskites. UV-vis absorption measurements on (C(6)H(5)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)SnI(4).(C(6)F(6)) thin films indicate a small reversible wavelength shift to higher energy for the tin(II) iodide framework exciton peak (with respect to that of the parent perovskite spectrum), from 608(2) nm [2.04 eV] to 595(2) nm [2.08 eV], and a corresponding shift in the band edge position. This spectral shift can most reasonably be attributed to subtle structural changes induced in the tin(II) iodide sheets by the intercalated hexafluorobenzene molecules.},

abstract = {Two organic-inorganic bismuth iodides of the form (H3N-R-NH3)BiI5 are reported, each containing long and relatively flexible organic groups, R. The norganic framework in each case consists of distorted BiI6 octahedra sharing cis vertexes to form zigzag chains. Crystals of (H3NC18H24S2NH3)BiI5 were grown from a slowly cooled ethylene glycol/2-butanol solution containing bismuth(III) iodide and AETH.2HI, where AETH = 1,6-bis[5'-(2' '-aminoethyl)-2'-thienyl]hexane. The new compound, (H2AETH)BiI5, adopts an orthorhombic (Aba2) cell with the lattice parameters a = 20.427(3) A, b = 35.078(5) A, c = 8.559(1) A, and Z = 8. The structure consists of corrugated layers of BiI5(2-) chains, with Bi-I bond lengths ranging from 2.942(3) to 3.233(3) A, separated by layers of the organic (H2AETH)(2+) cations. Crystals of the analogous (H3NC12H24NH3)BiI5 compound were also prepared from a concentrated aqueous hydriodic acid solution containing bismuth(III) iodide and the 1,12-dodecanediamine (DDDA) salt, DDDA.2HI. (H2DDDA)BiI5 crystallizes in an orthorhombic (Ibam) cell with a = 17.226(2) A, b = 34.277(4) A, c = 8.654(1) A, and Z = 8. The Bi-I bonds range in length from 2.929(1) to 3.271(1) A. While the inorganic chain structure is nearly identical for the two title compounds, as well as for the previously reported (H3NC6H12NH3)BiI5 [i.e., (H2DAH)BiI5] structure, the packing of the chains is strongly influenced by the choice of organic cation. Optical absorption spectra for thermally ablated thin films of the three organic-inorganic hybrids containing BiI5(2-) chains are reported as a function of temperature (25-290 K). The dominant long-wavelength feature in each case is attributed to an exciton band, which is apparent at room temperature and, despite the similar inorganic chain structure, varies in position from 491 to 541 nm (at 25 K).},

Each structure was refined in a monoclinic (C2/m) subcell, with the lattice parameters a = 39.712(13) A, b = 5.976(2) A, c = 6.043(2) A, beta = 92.238(5) degrees, and Z = 2 for M = Bi and a = 39.439(7) A, b = 5.952(1) A, c = 6.031(1) A, beta = 92.245(3) degrees, and Z = 2 for M = Sb. The trivalent metal cations locally adopt a distorted octahedral coordination, with M-I bond lengths ranging from 3.046(1) to 3.218(3) A (3.114 A average) for M = Bi and 3.012(1) to 3.153(2) A (3.073 A average) for M = Sb. The new organic-inorganic hybrids are the first members of a metal-deficient perovskite family consisting of (Mn+)2/nV(n-2)/nX4(2-) sheets, where V represents a vacancy (generally left out of the formula) and the metal cation valence, n, is greater than 2. The organic layers in the AEQT-based organic-inorganic hybrids feature edge-to-face aromatic interactions among the rigid, rodlike quaterthiophene moieties, which may help to stabilize the unusual metal-deficient layered structures.},

No evidence of the inorganic sheet excitonic transition is observed in the photoluminescence spectra for any of the chromophore-containing perovskites. However, strong quaterthiophene photoluminescence is observed for X = Cl, with an emission peak at approximately lambda(max) = 532 nm. Similar photoluminescence is observed for the X = Br and I materials, but with substantial quenching, as the inorganic layer band gap decreases relative to the chromophore HOMO-LUMO gap.},

(HO(CH(2))(2)NH(3))(2)PbI(4) adopts a monoclinic cell, a = 8.935(1) A, b= 9.056(2) A, c = 10.214(3) A, beta = 100.26(1) degrees , V = 813.3(3) A(3), P2(1)/a, and Z = 2, and (HO(CH(2))(2)NH(3))(2)PbBr(4) is orthorhombic, a = 8.4625(6) A, b = 8.647(1) A, c = 19.918(2) A, V = 1457.5(2) A(3), Pbcn, and Z = 4. In the layered structures, a unique hydrogen-bond network connects adjacent perovskite layers, owing to OH....X, NH(3)(+)....X, and intermolecular NH(3)(+)...OH interactions. Its impact on the bonding features of the inorganic framework and on the quite short interlayer distance, in the case of (HO(CH(2))(2)NH(3))(2)PbI(4), is shown. As a result, a significant red shift of the exciton peaks (lambda = 536 nm (X = I), lambda = 417 nm (X = Br)), compared to other PbX(4)(2)(-)-based perovskite hybrids, is observed, revealing a reduced band gap. A reversible structural transition occurs at T = 96 degrees C (X = I) and T = 125 degrees C (X = Br). An orthorhombic cell of the high-temperature phase of (HO(CH(2))(2)NH(3))(2)PbI(4) with a(HT) = 18.567(6) A, b(HT) = 13.833(6) A, c(HT) = 6.437(2) A, and V = 1653 A(3) is proposed from powder X-ray diffraction. A change in the hydrogen bonding occurs, with molecules standing up in the interlayer space and OH parts probably interacting together, leading to a more conventional situation for ammonium groups and a more distorted perovskite layer. This is in accordance with the blue shift of the exciton peak to lambda = 505 nm (X = I) or to lambda = 374 nm (X = Br) during the phase transition.},

abstract = {The compounds catena-poly[p-phenylenediammonium [[diiodolead(II)]-di-mu-iodo] dihydrate], \{(C6H10N2)[PbI4].2H2O\}n, (I), and catena-poly[bis(3,5-dimethylanilinium) [[diiodolead(II)]-di-mu-iodo]], \{(C8H12N)2[PbI4]\}n, (II), crystallize as organic-inorganic hybrids. As such, the structures consist of chains of [PbI2]- units extending along the c axis in (I) and along the b axis in (II). The asymmetric unit in (I) contains one Pb atom on a site of 2/m symmetry, two I atoms and a water molecule on mirror planes, and a p-phenylenediammonium molecule that sits around a site of 2/m symmetry with the C and N atoms on a mirror plane. In (II), the Pb atom is on a twofold axis and the two I atoms are on general positions. Each Pb atom is octahedrally coordinated to six I atoms, arranged as chains of edge-sharing octahedra. Both compounds undergo hydrogen-bonding interactions between the ammonium groups and the I atoms. In addition, there are hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and the ammonium groups and halides in (I), and between the ammonium groups and the ring systems in (II).},

abstract = {We report on optical spectroscopy (photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation) on two-dimensional self-organized layers of (C(6)H(5)C(2)H(4)-NH(3))(2)-PbI(4) perovskite. Temperature and excitation power dependance of the optical spectra gives a new insight into the excitonic and the phononic properties of this hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductor. In particular, exciton-phonon interaction is found to be more than one order of magnitude higher than in GaAs QWs. As a result, photoluminescence emission lines have to be interpreted in the framework of a polaron model.},

Pre-melt and melting transitions of alkylammonium chains in C12-, C16-, and C18-PI. Dynamic rotational disorder of NH3 goups occurs at pre-melt, and conformational disorder giving varied tilt angles occurs at melt, leading to overall increase of c lattice parameter, and thus volume.

Both 1 and 2 have interesting structural characteristics; it is unprecedented that the ribbons are linked via I(2) molecules incorporated in the lattice of 1, while tetrameric water clusters are trapped in the structure of 2. 2 undergoes a (reversible) water desorption process at 310 K leading to (NH(3)(CH(2))(2)SS(CH(2))(2)NH(3))(6)Pb(5)I(22).2H(2)O (3). The electrical behavior of 2 and 3 has been investigated in the ranges 293-310 K and 310-358 K respectively. Above 310 K, the electronic contribution remains constant while the ionic transference number tends towards unity showing almost pure ionic transport at 360 K (6 x 10(-7) S cm(-1) at 330 K) originating probably from the migration of protons through the hydrogen bonds connecting the water molecules to the cystamine counter cations.},

abstract = {We have studied the optical property and electronic structure of an inorganic-organic quasi-one-dimensional crystal, methylviologen lead iodide. Two absorption bands were observed in the near ultraviolet and visible regions. The one is an absorption band at 3.1 eV with a large oscillator strength, which is assigned to onedimensional excitons confined in the inorganic chains. The other is a broad band observed between 2.0 and 2.8 eV and attributed to charge-transfer transitions from the lead iodide chains to the methylviologen molecules. From the luminescence excitation spectra, it is found that there are two kinds of charge-transfer transitions from the valence band and the nonbonding state of the inorganic chains to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of methylviologen.},

abstract = {We have studied the optical property and electronic structure of an inorganic-organic quasi-one-dimensional crystal, methylviologen lead iodide. Two absorption bands were observed in the near ultraviolet and visible regions. The one is an absorption band at 3.1 eV with a large oscillator strength, which is assigned to onedimensional excitons confined in the inorganic chains. The other is a broad band observed between 2.0 and 2.8 eV and attributed to charge-transfer transitions from the lead iodide chains to the methylviologen molecules. From the luminescence excitation spectra, it is found that there are two kinds of charge-transfer transitions from the valence band and the nonbonding state of the inorganic chains to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of methylviologen.},

The linear absorption and fluorescence maxima and the molar extinction coefficients are in the order of C1<C2<C3 in various solvents. Two-photon absorption (TPA) up-converted emission of the derivatives were determined with Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser. The maximal TPA emission wavelength and the two-photon absorption cross section of the derivatives are also in the order of C1<C2<C3 in various solvents. The dipole moment changes of the derivatives between the excited state and the ground state were estimated from experiment, and they are in the order of C1<C2<C3, which is confirmed further by the molecular geometry optimization of the derivatives. The electron density distribution and the energy levels of the frontier orbital of the derivatives were analyzed. The cyclic voltammograms of the derivatives were performed and discussed.},

abstract = {Optoelectronic-compatible heterostructures are fabricated from layered inorganic-organic multiple quantum wells (IO-MQW) of Cyclohexenyl ethyl ammonium lead iodide, (C(6)H(9)C(2)H(4)NH(3))(2)PbI(4) (CHPI). These hybrids possess strongly-resonant optical features, are thermally stable and compatible with hybrid photonics assembly. Room-temperature strong-coupling is observed when these hybrids are straightforwardly embedded in metal-air (M-A) and metal-metal (M-M) low-Q microcavities, due to the large oscillator strength of these IO-MQWs. The strength of the Rabi splitting is 130 meV for M-A and 160 meV for M-M cavities. These values are significantly higher than for J-aggregates in all-metal microcavities of similar length. These experimental results are in good agreement with transfer matrix simulations based on resonant excitons. Incorporating exciton-switching hybrids allows active control of the strong-coupling parameters by temperature, suggesting new device applications.},

abstract = {Magnetoreflection spectra in the Faraday configuration have been investigated up to 40 T at 4.2K for a single crystal of (CmH\~{}INHs)2PbI4, which consists of twodimensional networks of corner-sharing octahedra [PbIs] 4-. The Zeeman shift is observed, and the effective g-factor is 1.42 4-0.04. The observed diamagnetic shift of the lowest exciton is (7 4- 4) x 10-SeV/T 2, from which the two-dimensionai Bohr radius is estimated to be 7/\~{} at most. It suggests that the exciton wave function extends only to the 4 nearest neighbor octahedra [PbI0]4-in the two-dimensional layer. By referring to the resonant Raman scattering spectra and refection spectra of strained single crystals, a few narrow dips in high reflectivity region of the lowest exciton are ascribed to the vibronic excitons.

abstract = {Single crystals of the layered organic-inorganic perovskites, [NH(2)C(I=NH(2)](2)(CH(3)NH(3))m SnmI3m+2, were prepared by an aqueous solution growth technique. In contrast to the recently discovered family, (C(4)H(9)NH(3))(2)(CH(3)NH(3))n-1SnnI3n+1, which consists of (100)-terminated perovskite layers, structure determination reveals an unusual structural class with sets of m <110>-oriented CH(3)NH(3)SnI(3) perovskite sheets separated by iodoformamidinium cations. Whereas the m = 2 compound is semiconducting with a band gap of 0.33 +/- 0.05 electron volt, increasing m leads to more metallic character. The ability to control perovskite sheet orientation through the choice of organic cation demonstrates the flexibility provided by organic-inorganic perovskites and adds an important handle for tailoring and understanding lower dimensional transport in layered perovskites.},

Due to the high charge density and small size of the organic cation, the separation of the perovskite layers is small and short iodine-iodine contacts of 4.19 A are formed between the layers. Optical thin-film measurements on this compound indicate a significant red shift of the exciton peak (630 nm) associated with the band gap, as compared with other SnI(4)(2)(-)-based layered perovskite structures.},
